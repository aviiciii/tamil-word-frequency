# Tamil Words Filtering and Frequency Processing

This repository provides a Python script that allows for efficient filtering and processing of words and their frequencies in a CSV file. The script focuses on filtering non-Tamil words and removing trailing punctuation from a large dataset.

## Description

The Word Filtering and Frequency Processing script is designed to handle large datasets efficiently. It filters out non-Tamil words and removes trailing punctuation marks, resulting in a cleaner and more meaningful word-frequency dataset. The processed data can be used for various linguistic research, natural language processing tasks, and data analysis purposes.

## Features

- Word Filtering: The script filters out non-Tamil words from the input CSV file, providing a cleaner dataset for Tamil language analysis.
- Trailing Punctuation Removal: The script removes trailing punctuation marks from words, enhancing data quality and compatibility with natural language processing tasks.
- CSV Output: The processed words and their frequencies are saved in a CSV file, making it easy to integrate the results into downstream applications.
